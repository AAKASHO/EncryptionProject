# 🔐 Encryption and Decryption Program

Welcome to the **Encryption and Decryption Program** — a simple, console-based tool designed to help users encrypt and decrypt sensitive information like passwords, messages, or confidential notes using a variety of classical cipher techniques.

---

## 📜 Description

This program provides multiple encryption and decryption methods, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your important data.  
You can **encrypt** a fresh password/message or **decrypt** one that was previously encrypted using one of the provided ciphers.

---

## 📋 Features

- Affine Cipher
- Route Cipher
- Atbash Cipher
- Vigenère Cipher
- Baconian Cipher
- Simple Substitution Cipher
- Polybius Square Cipher
- Morse Code Cipher
- XOR Cipher
- Rail-Fence Cipher
- Exit Option

Each cipher has its own logic implemented, giving users flexibility to secure their data in various ways.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run the Program.**
2. **Choose** the type of cipher you want to use (options 1–10).
3. **Follow the on-screen instructions** for encryption or decryption.
4. **Exit** the program anytime by selecting option 11.
